    <div id="Model-Based" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>What does this method do?</h3>
    <p>Model-based methods create a mathematical model that represents how a time series should behave under normal conditions. If a new data point significantly deviates from the model's prediction, it is flagged as an anomaly.</p>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>The method builds a predictive model using historical data and calculates expected values for new observations. If a point falls outside the expected range, it is considered an anomaly.</p>
    
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>Imagine you check your electricity bill every month, and it's always around $50-$60. Suddenly, one month you receive a $500 bill - this is an anomaly.</p>
    
    <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>In industrial monitoring, machines have an expected operating temperature range. If a sensor detects a sudden and significant increase in temperature, the system identifies it as an anomaly, possibly indicating a malfunction.</p>
    
    <h3>How to use this method?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Train a model using past data.</li>
        <li>Predict future values based on historical trends.</li>
        <li>Compare actual values to predictions.</li>
        <li>Flag significant deviations as anomalies.</li>
    </ul>
</div><div id="Density-Based" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>What does this method do?</h3>
    <p>Density-based methods detect anomalies by examining how closely grouped data points are. Normal points cluster together, while anomalies appear isolated.</p>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>A density-based algorithm calculates the local density around each point. If a point is far from all clusters, it is considered an anomaly.</p>
    
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>Imagine a concert where most people stand in groups. If one person is standing alone far away, they would seem unusual.</p>
    
    <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>Credit card fraud detection: most transactions occur in expected locations and within a common price range. If a transaction is made from a different country and for an unusually high amount, it might be flagged as fraudulent.</p>
    
    <h3>How to use this method?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather data - collect time series values.</li>
        <li>Apply a density-based algorithm - e.g., DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).</li>
        <li>Flag outliers - points in low-density areas are considered anomalies.</li>
    </ul>
</div><div id="Histogramming" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>What does this method do?</h3>
    <p>Histogramming divides the data into bins and analyzes the frequency of values within each bin. Rare values fall into sparsely populated bins, marking them as potential anomalies.</p>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>The algorithm creates a histogram of historical data and then checks whether new values fit within common bins or belong to rare ones.</p>
    
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>If you count how many times students attend school per month, and most students attend 18-22 days, but one student attends only one day, this would stand out.</p>
    
    <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>In monitoring website response times, if most pages load within 200ms but one request takes 5000ms, this suggests an issue with the server.</p>
    
    <h3>How to use this method?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Build a histogram - define bins based on past data.</li>
        <li>Compare new values - if a point falls into an unexpected bin, it is flagged as an anomaly.</li>
    </ul>
</div><div id="Discord Detection" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>What does this method do?</h3>
    <p>Discord detection identifies the most unusual subsequences in a time series - those that significantly differ from all others.</p>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>The method compares each subsequence with all others and finds the one that deviates the most.</p>
    
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>If you usually exercise for 30 minutes daily but one day suddenly exercise for 3 hours, that would be unusual.</p>
    
    <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>In medical ECG monitoring, most heartbeats follow a predictable pattern. If a patient suddenly exhibits an irregular pattern, it could indicate a health problem.</p>
    
    <h3>How to use this method?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extract all subsequences from the time series.</li>
        <li>Measure their similarity using distance metrics.</li>
        <li>Flag the most dissimilar subsequence as a potential anomaly.</li>
    </ul>
</div><div id="Dissimilarity-Based" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>What does this method do?</h3>
    <p>Dissimilarity-based methods compare different subsequences within a time series and detect patterns that are significantly different from the rest.</p>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>These methods identify sequences that do not match known patterns by measuring similarity between subsequences.</p>
    
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>If you sign your name the same way every day, but one day your signature looks entirely different, it would be an anomaly.</p>
    
    <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>In manufacturing, machines follow predictable operational patterns. If a machine's vibration pattern changes significantly, it could indicate wear or an impending breakdown.</p>
    
    <h3>How to use this method?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extract subsequences from the data.</li>
        <li>Measure dissimilarity using distance metrics.</li>
        <li>Identify highly dissimilar sequences as anomalies.</li>
    </ul>
</div><div id="Frequency-Based" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>What does this method do?</h3>
    <p>This method analyzes periodic patterns in a time series. If the expected frequency suddenly changes or disappears, it may indicate an anomaly.</p>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>It applies a Fourier Transform or other frequency analysis techniques to examine the dominant frequencies in the data.</p>
    
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>A clock rings every hour. If it suddenly rings every 30 minutes or stops ringing entirely, something is wrong.</p>
    
    <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>In power grid monitoring, electricity should operate at a stable 50Hz frequency. A deviation from this frequency might indicate a fault in the power system.</p>
    
    <h3>How to use this method?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze periodic signals in the data.</li>
        <li>Compare observed frequencies with expected ones.</li>
        <li>Flag sudden frequency changes as anomalies.</li>
    </ul>
</div><div id="Information Theory" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>What does this method do?</h3>
    <p>Information theory-based methods measure changes in entropy (randomness). A sudden increase in entropy suggests the system has become less predictable, indicating an anomaly.</p>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>It calculates entropy or compression complexity over time and detects periods where the randomness significantly increases.</p>
    
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>If a classroom is usually quiet but suddenly students start yelling chaotically, the unpredictability has increased, signaling a shift.</p>
    
    <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>In cybersecurity, network traffic usually follows predictable patterns. If entropy suddenly increases, it may indicate a cyberattack or an unexpected system behavior.</p>
    
    <h3>How to use this method?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Compute entropy over time.</li>
        <li>Monitor for unexpected increases.</li>
        <li>Flag high-entropy periods as potential anomalies.</li>
    </ul>
